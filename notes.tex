Hello, here are the notes for Mr.\ Stern's Complex Analysis class.
The class was taught in the same order as is presented in Lars Ahlfors'
\textit{Complex Analysis} textbook.
Hopefully you can use the notes as a reference, but it is by no means
a substitute for the textbook.
Please point out any errors by posting \href{https://github.com/mkendall17/cmplxnotes1819}{here}.

Enjoy!
