\begin{theorem}
    Let $f$ be analytic and nonvanishing in a simply connected
    region $U$.
    Then there exists a \textit{single-valued analytic branch} of
    $\log f(z)$:  an analytic funciton $g(z)$ defined
    on $U$ such that 
    \[ e^{g(z)} \equiv f(z) \]
    for all $z \in U$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Consider $f'(z)/f(z)$.
    Note that it is analytic in $U$ because $f$ is nonvanishing.
    By Cauchy Goursat we know $f'(z)/f(z)$ has an antiderivative,
    call it $F(z)$.
    Consider $f(z)e^{-F(z)}$.
    Note that
    \[ \frac{d}{dz} [f(z)e^{-F(z)}] = f'(z)e^{-F(z)} - f(z)F'(z)e^{-F(z)}
    = f'(z)e^{-F(z)} - f'(z) e^{-F(z)} \equiv 0. \]
    This means we can pick a $z_0$ such that $f(z)e^{-F(z)}=
    f(z_0)e^{-F(z_0)}$.
    We can pick a branch of log and solve for $f(z)$ to find:
    \[ f(z) = e^{\Log f(z_0) + F(z) - F(z_0)}, \]
    so we can let $g(z) = \Log f(z_0) + F(z) - F(z_0)$ as
    desired.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Further Versions of Cauchy Goursat}
\begin{theorem}
    Let $f$ be analytic in \textit{region} $U$.
    Suppose $\sigma$ is a closed \textit{zig-zag} polygon path
    inside $U$ such that $n(\sigma, a) = 0$ for all $a \notin U$.
    Then
    \[ \int_{\sigma} f = 0 \]
\end{theorem}
Note how the $n(\sigma, a) = 0$ condition replaces the simple
connectivity of $U$.
Also note that this theorem is not sufficient for $f$ to be
independent of path.
But the proof is still identical because none of the necessary
conditions were taken away.

\begin{exercise}
    Prove the above theorem, except $\sigma$ is \textit{any} path
    inside $U$ such that $n(\sigma, a) = 0$.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Homology Form of Cauchy Goursat}
\begin{definition}
    We say that a cycle $\beta$ in region $U$ is \term{homologous
    to $0$ modulo $U$} written
    \[ \beta \sim 0 \pmod{U}, \]
    if for all $a \in U$, $n(\beta, a) = 0$.
    We also say $\beta$ ``bounds in $U$.''
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Two cycles $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are \term{homologous 
    modulo $U$}, denoted $\beta_1 \sim \beta_2$ if
    \[ [\beta_1] - [\beta_2] \sim 0 \pmod{U}. \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Homology Form of Cauchy Goursat]
    If $\beta$ is a cycle inside $U$ such that $\beta \sim 0
    \pmod{U}$ and if $f$ is analytic on $U$, then
    \[ \int_{\beta} f = 0. \]
\end{theorem}
